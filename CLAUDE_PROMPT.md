# 🚀 Claude.ai Prompt - AutoRestock Email System Issue

## 🎯 **TASK: Resolve Microsoft 365 Email Delivery Issue**

I need you to help resolve an email delivery issue with our AutoRestock email processing system. The system is 95% complete and functional, but Microsoft 365 is blocking emails from our sending domain.

---

## ✅ **What's Working Perfectly**

### **Complete Email Processing System**
- **Cloudflare Email Routing**: ✅ Receiving emails correctly
- **Cloudflare Worker**: ✅ Processing emails successfully  
- **Email-ingestion-service**: ✅ Receiving and processing emails (200 status)
- **Order Extraction**: ✅ Working perfectly (`{"ok": true, "extracted": true}`)
- **SMTP Configuration**: ✅ Sending emails successfully (`250 2.0.0 Ok: queued`)
- **Gmail Delivery**: ✅ Emails arrive (in junk folder)

### **System Architecture**
```
Email → Cloudflare → Worker → Email-service → SMTP → User Inbox
  ✅        ✅        ✅         ✅         ✅      ❌ (M365 blocking)
```

## ❌ **The Problem: M365 Email Blocking**

### **Evidence**
- **SMTP Success**: Emails sent successfully (`250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as 4cgyyL2SNdz3hhTs`)
- **Gmail Receives**: Emails arrive in Gmail (junk folder)
- **M365 Blocks**: No emails reach `ebay@ljmuk.co.uk` or `jake@ljmuk.co.uk`

### **What We've Tried**
1. ✅ **Added DKIM records** to `ljmuk.co.uk` domain
2. ✅ **Verified SMTP credentials** work perfectly
3. ✅ **Tested with multiple email addresses**
4. ✅ **Confirmed emails are being sent** (SMTP accepts them)

### **Current Configuration**
```bash
SMTP_HOST="mail.privateemail.com"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER="noreply@autorestock.app"
SMTP_PASS="Yb21xzl!"
SMTP_FROM="AutoRestock <noreply@autorestock.app>"
```

## 🎯 **What I Need You To Do**

### **Primary Goal**
Get emails from `noreply@autorestock.app` to successfully deliver to Microsoft 365 inboxes (`ebay@ljmuk.co.uk` and `jake@ljmuk.co.uk`).

### **Approaches to Try**

1. **Microsoft 365 Safe Senders Configuration**
   - Add `noreply@autorestock.app` to safe senders list
   - Configure anti-spam policies to allow emails
   - Set up mail flow rules to bypass filtering

2. **Email Authentication Improvements**
   - Verify SPF, DKIM, DMARC records are correct
   - Check if `autorestock.app` domain needs better authentication

3. **Alternative Sending Configuration**
   - Use a different sending domain that M365 trusts more
   - Configure dedicated sending domain with proper reputation

4. **Microsoft 365 Message Trace**
   - Use M365 admin tools to see why emails are being blocked
   - Check quarantine and delivery reports

## 📊 **Test Results Summary**

### **Successful Tests**
- Order extraction: ✅ Working
- SMTP sending: ✅ Working (`250 2.0.0 Ok: queued`)
- Gmail delivery: ✅ Working (arrives in junk)
- Email processing pipeline: ✅ Working

### **Failed Tests**
- M365 delivery: ❌ No emails received at all
- Both `ebay@ljmuk.co.uk` and `jake@ljmuk.co.uk` affected

---

## 🔧 **Environment Details**

- **Email Service**: Microsoft 365 for `ljmuk.co.uk` domain
- **Sending Domain**: `autorestock.app` (hosted on Namecheap PrivateEmail)
- **SMTP Server**: `mail.privateemail.com`
- **Target Addresses**: 
  - `ebay@ljmuk.co.uk` (shared folder)
  - `jake@ljmuk.co.uk` (main account)

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

1. **Emails from `noreply@autorestock.app` successfully deliver to M365 inboxes**
2. **No more blocking by M365 spam filters**
3. **Complete end-to-end email processing working**

---

## 💡 **Priority Actions**

1. **Start with M365 safe senders configuration** (quickest fix)
2. **Use M365 admin tools to diagnose the blocking**
3. **Consider alternative sending domains if needed**

The system is fully functional except for this final delivery step. Once resolved, the complete AutoRestock email processing and order extraction system will be 100% operational.
