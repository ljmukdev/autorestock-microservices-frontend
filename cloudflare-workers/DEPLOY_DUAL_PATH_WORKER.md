# Deploy Dual-Path Email Worker

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Worker Does:

1. **Receives email** at Cloudflare
2. **Sends full email** to AutoRestock Email Ingestion Service (for processing)
3. **Forwards copy** to user's personal inbox
4. **Both happen simultaneously!**

---

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Steps:

### Step 1: Update Cloudflare Worker

1. **Go to:** Cloudflare Dashboard â†’ Workers & Pages â†’ **email-router**
2. **Click:** "Edit Code" or "Quick Edit"
3. **Replace all code** with the contents of `email-router-dual.js`
4. **Click:** "Save and Deploy"

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in the Worker:

```
INGESTION_SERVICE_URL=https://autorestock-email-ingestion-service-production.up.railway.app
CF_WEBHOOK_TOKEN=<your-webhook-token>
```

### Step 3: Create Email Ingestion Endpoint

We need to add a new endpoint `/inbound/process` to the Email Ingestion Service that:
- Accepts full email content
- Stores it in MongoDB
- Processes order data
- Returns success

## ðŸ”„ Email Flow:

```
eBay â†’ ebay-jake@in.autorestock.app
  â†“
Cloudflare Worker receives
  â†“
  â”œâ”€â†’ POST full email to Email Ingestion Service
  â”‚    â†“
  â”‚   Store in MongoDB
  â”‚    â†“
  â”‚   Extract order data
  â”‚    â†“
  â”‚   Process inventory/sales
  â”‚
  â””â”€â†’ Forward copy to jake@ljmuk.co.uk
       â†“
      User gets email in inbox
```

## âœ… Benefits:

- âœ… AutoRestock processes every order automatically
- âœ… Users still receive emails in their inbox
- âœ… Complete audit trail in database
- âœ… Can build email dashboard later (Phase 2)
- âœ… No spam issues (users get original emails)
