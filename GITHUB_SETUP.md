# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up your StockPilot repository on GitHub and configure it for Railway deployment.

## üöÄ Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Create Repository on GitHub.com

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `stockpilot`
   - **Description**: `Microservice-based inventory management system for reselling`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **Initialize**: Don't check any boxes (we already have files)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Option B: Create Repository via GitHub CLI

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# Windows: winget install GitHub.cli
# Or download from: https://cli.github.com/

# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Create repository
gh repo create stockpilot --public --description "Microservice-based inventory management system for reselling"
```

## üîó Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stockpilot.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## üîê Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets for Railway

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add the following secrets:

### Required Secrets

| Secret Name | Description | How to Get |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| `RAILWAY_TOKEN` | Railway authentication token | Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Account ‚Üí Tokens ‚Üí New Token |

### How to Get Railway Token

1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click on your profile picture (top right)
3. Select "Account Settings"
4. Go to "Tokens" tab
5. Click "New Token"
6. Give it a name like "GitHub Actions"
7. Copy the token and add it to GitHub secrets

## üöÄ Step 4: Enable GitHub Actions

The repository already includes GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. These will:

- Run tests on every push and pull request
- Automatically deploy to Railway when code is pushed to `main` branch
- Deploy all microservices and the API Gateway

### Workflow Features

- **Testing**: Runs tests for the API Gateway
- **Deployment**: Automatically deploys to Railway on main branch pushes
- **Multi-service**: Deploys all core services (API Gateway, Purchases, Sales, Inventory, Settings)

## üìä Step 5: Monitor Deployments

### GitHub Actions Tab
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. View deployment status and logs

### Railway Dashboard
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. View your deployed services
3. Monitor logs and performance

## üîß Step 6: Configure Branch Protection (Optional)

To ensure code quality, you can set up branch protection rules:

1. Go to repository "Settings" ‚Üí "Branches"
2. Click "Add rule"
3. Configure:
   - **Branch name pattern**: `main`
   - **Require pull request reviews**: ‚úÖ
   - **Require status checks**: ‚úÖ
   - **Require branches to be up to date**: ‚úÖ

## üöÄ Step 7: Deploy to Railway

### Automatic Deployment
Once you push to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically deploy to Railway.

### Manual Deployment
You can also deploy manually using the Railway CLI:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy API Gateway
cd api-gateway
railway up

# Deploy microservices
cd ../microservices/purchases-service
railway up
# Repeat for other services...
```

## üìã Step 8: Verify Deployment

### Check GitHub Actions
1. Go to "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Verify all workflows are passing
3. Check deployment logs for any errors

### Check Railway Services
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Verify all services are running
3. Check service URLs and health endpoints

### Test Frontend
1. Get your API Gateway URL from Railway
2. Visit the URL in your browser
3. Test the application functionality

## üîÑ Step 9: Continuous Development

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branches for new features
2. Make changes and test locally
3. Push to feature branch
4. Create pull request to `main`
5. Review and merge
6. Automatic deployment to Railway

### Environment Management
- **Development**: Local development with local services
- **Staging**: Railway deployment for testing
- **Production**: Railway deployment for live use

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **GitHub Actions Failing**
   - Check if `RAILWAY_TOKEN` secret is set correctly
   - Verify Railway CLI is working: `railway whoami`
   - Check workflow logs for specific errors

2. **Railway Deployment Issues**
   - Check service logs in Railway dashboard
   - Verify environment variables are set
   - Ensure all dependencies are in package.json

3. **Frontend Not Loading**
   - Check if API Gateway is running
   - Verify service URLs are correct
   - Check browser console for errors

### Getting Help

- Check the `DEPLOYMENT.md` file for detailed deployment instructions
- Review individual service READMEs in the `microservices/` directory
- Create an issue in the GitHub repository for bugs or questions

## üìà Next Steps

1. **Set up monitoring**: Configure alerts and monitoring for production
2. **Add CI/CD**: Enhance GitHub Actions with more comprehensive testing
3. **Database setup**: Configure MongoDB for production use
4. **Custom domains**: Set up custom domains for your services
5. **Scaling**: Configure auto-scaling based on traffic
