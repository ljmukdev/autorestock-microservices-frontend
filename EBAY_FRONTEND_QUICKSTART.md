# eBay Frontend - Quick Start Guide ðŸš€

## What You Have Now

A complete eBay purchases frontend that connects to your working microservice at:
`https://delightful-liberation-production.up.railway.app`

**No backend changes were made - your eBay microservice is untouched!**

---

## Files Created (Summary)

### 5 New UI Components
1. `EbayDashboard.tsx` - Stats overview
2. `EbaySyncControls.tsx` - Sync button with feedback
3. `EbayPurchaseFilters.tsx` - Search & filters
4. `EbayPurchasesList.tsx` - Purchases table/cards
5. `EbayPurchaseDetail.tsx` - Single purchase view

### 2 New Pages
1. `/ebay` - Main purchases dashboard
2. `/ebay/purchase/[id]` - Purchase detail page

---

## Build & Deploy (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Build Locally
```bash
cd frontends/app

# Install dependencies (if needed)
pnpm install

# Build UI packages
pnpm -r --filter='@autorestock/*' build

# Build Next.js app
pnpm build
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variable on Railway
In Railway dashboard â†’ Frontend Service â†’ Variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_EBAY_SERVICE_URL=https://delightful-liberation-production.up.railway.app
```

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add eBay purchases frontend with dashboard, filters, and detail views"
git push origin main
```

Railway will auto-deploy!

# Set environment variable
$env:NEXT_PUBLIC_EBAY_SERVICE_URL="https://delightful-liberation-production.up.railway.app"

# Run dev server

## Troubleshooting

### "No purchases found"

- Try manual sync (Sync Now button)
- Check backend at: `https://delightful-liberation-production.up.railway.app/purchases`

### API errors
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_EBAY_SERVICE_URL` is set on Railway
- Check backend is running: `https://delightful-liberation-production.up.railway.app/health`

### Build errors

- Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
- Clear `.next` folder and rebuild

## What's Next?

Your eBay frontend is ready! You can now:

1. **View all purchases** from eBay with tracking data
2. **Sync manually** or wait for automatic 2-hour syncs
3. **Filter and search** purchases easily
4. **Track package status** with carrier info
5. **Link directly** to eBay items and sellers

---

## Architecture

```
Frontend (Next.js)
    â†“ fetch()
eBay Microservice (Express)
    â†“ OAuth + API calls
eBay API
    â†“
MongoDB (ebay_raw_purchases)
```

**Data Flow:**
1. User visits `/ebay`
2. Frontend calls `${NEXT_PUBLIC_EBAY_SERVICE_URL}/purchases`
3. Backend returns data from MongoDB
4. Frontend displays in table/cards
5. User can sync to fetch latest from eBay
