- ✅ Matches existing AutoRestock design language
- ✅ Uses `@autorestock/ui-kit` components (Card, Button, Input)

- ✅ lucide-react icons throughout
- ✅ Responsive breakpoints (mobile-first)

### Color Scheme
- **Blue** (`blue-600`): Primary actions, navigation
- **Green** (`green-600`): Success states, delivered items
- **Yellow** (`yellow-600`): In-transit items
- **Red** (`red-600`): Errors
- **Gray** (`gray-50/500/900`): Text and backgrounds

### Responsive Design
- Desktop: Full table layout
- Mobile: Card-based layout
- Tablet: Hybrid approach

## 🔌 API Integration

### Endpoints Used:
```typescript
// Fetch purchases
GET ${ebayServiceUrl}/purchases?limit=100

// Sync purchases
GET ${ebayServiceUrl}/sync/purchases?days=7&limit=100

// Note: Currently fetches all purchases for detail view
// Could be optimized with a single-item endpoint later
```

### Environment Variable
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_EBAY_SERVICE_URL=https://delightful-liberation-production.up.railway.app
```

---

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### 1. Build the UI Components
```bash
cd frontends/app
pnpm install
pnpm -r --filter='@autorestock/*' build
```

### 2. Build Next.js App
```bash
pnpm build
```

### 3. Set Environment Variable on Railway
In your Railway dashboard for the frontend service:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_EBAY_SERVICE_URL=https://delightful-liberation-production.up.railway.app
```

### 4. Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add eBay purchases frontend"
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically rebuild and deploy!

## 🔄 Data Flow

```

    ↓
Fetch purchases from API
    ↓
Display dashboard stats
    ↓
Apply filters (search/date/status)
    ↓
Render filtered list
    ↓
User clicks purchase

    ↓
Display detailed view
```

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Ideas:
1. **Single Purchase Endpoint**: Add `/purchases/:itemId` to backend for faster detail loading
2. **Pagination**: Handle large datasets (1000+ purchases)
3. **Export to CSV**: Download filtered purchase data
4. **Advanced Analytics**: 
   - Spending trends over time
   - Top sellers analysis
   - Average shipping costs
5. **Tracking Integration**: 
   - Live tracking status from carriers
   - Delivery notifications
6. **Bulk Actions**:
   - Mark multiple as received
   - Export selected purchases
7. **OAuth Integration**: 
   - Show connection status
   - Re-authenticate button
   - Token expiry warnings

---

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Current Approach:
- Fetches all purchases on page load
- Client-side filtering (fast for <1000 items)
- No pagination yet

### Optimization for Scale:
- Add server-side pagination
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Cache purchases in localStorage
- Add React Query for smart caching

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

```
Frontend Framework:  Next.js 14 (App Router)
Language:            TypeScript
Styling:             Tailwind CSS
UI Components:       @autorestock/ui-kit
Icons:               lucide-react
State Management:    React useState/useEffect
API Calls:           Native fetch()
Routing:             Next.js App Router
```

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Authentication Check**: Assumes user is already authenticated via eBay OAuth
   - Could add redirect to onboarding if not connected

2. **Fetch All for Detail**: Purchase detail page fetches all purchases to find one
   - Should add single-purchase endpoint to backend (non-breaking)

3. **No Persistence**: Filters/search reset on page refresh
   - Could use URL query params for shareable filtered views

4. **Manual Sync**: No automatic sync on schedule
   - Backend GitHub Actions handles this (every 2 hours)

---

## ✅ Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Modern, clean UI matching AutoRestock design
- ✅ All 13 purchase fields displayed
- ✅ Filtering and search functionality
- ✅ Sync controls with feedback
- ✅ Dashboard stats
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile + desktop)
- ✅ Detail view for individual purchases
- ✅ External links to eBay
- ✅ Loading and error states
- ✅ **NO BACKEND CHANGES REQUIRED** ✅

---

## 🎓 Code Quality

- TypeScript for type safety
- Consistent naming conventions
- Reusable components
- Proper props interfaces
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Accessibility considerations (semantic HTML)
- Mobile-first responsive design

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Railway logs** for backend errors
2. **Check browser console** for frontend errors
3. **Verify environment variable** is set correctly
4. **Test API endpoints** directly (use `/diag` endpoint)
5. **Ensure OAuth** is connected via `/users/onboarding`

---

## 🎉 You're Done!

The eBay Purchases frontend is complete and ready to use! 

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy to Railway
2. Test the full flow
3. Enjoy your new eBay purchase tracking system!
