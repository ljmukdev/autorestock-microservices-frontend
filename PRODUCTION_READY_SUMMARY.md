## 📧 Email Flow (Current Implementation)

```
User creates alias: ebay-shop@in.autorestock.app
  ↓
Backend calls Cloudflare API
  ↓
Routing rule created automatically:
  ebay-shop@in.autorestock.app → ebay@company.com
  ↓
Email sent to: ebay-shop@in.autorestock.app
  ↓
Cloudflare forwards to: ebay@company.com
  ↓
Email arrives (may be in junk initially)
  ↓
User follows whitelist instructions
  ↓
✅ Future emails go to inbox
```

## 🔮 Phase 2: Email Inbox Microservice (Future)

```
Email arrives at Cloudflare
  ↓
Worker sends full email to Email Ingestion Service
  ↓

  ↓
NO forwarding = NO spam issues ✅
```

### Benefits:

- Full email management
- Better data extraction
- Email search and filtering
- Attachment handling
- Professional experience

### Estimated Effort: 4-6 hours
- Email storage model (already exists in Email Ingestion Service)
